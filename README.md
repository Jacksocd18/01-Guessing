# 01-Guessing
A guessing game made for a C220, a guessing game written in Python. The purpose of this game is to teach me about simple data types and control structures.

In this game the player is asked to guess a number between 1 and 100. The player can choose as many times as they want until they get the number correct. If the player gets the number correct the player wins and can choose to keep playing or to end the game.
